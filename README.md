# Mishka Elixir Developer Tools

We tried to deliver a series of our client's [**CMS**](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka-cms) built on [**Elixir**](https://elixir-lang.org/) at the start of the [**Mishka Group**](https://github.com/mishka-group) project, but we recently archived this open-source project and have yet to make plans to rework and expand it. This system was created using [**Phoenix**](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [**Phoenix LiveView**](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html). After a long period, a series of macros and functional modules emerged from this project and our other projects, which we are gradually publishing in this library.
