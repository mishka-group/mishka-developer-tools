  ### Bcrypt

  - `bcrypt_elixir`: https://hex.pm/packages/bcrypt_elixir
  - `LICENSE`: https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/blob/master/LICENSE

  > #### Use cases information {: .warning}
  >
  > Make sure you have a `C compiler` installed. See the Comeonin wiki for details.
  > Wiki link: https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/wiki/Requirements

  Bcrypt is a key derivation function for passwords designed by Niels
  Provos and David Mazi√®res. Bcrypt is an adaptive function, which means
  that it can be configured to remain slow and resistant to brute-force
  attacks even as computational power increases.

  Bcrypt has no known vulnerabilities and has been widely tested for over 15 years.
  However, as it has a low memory use, it is susceptible to GPU cracking attacks.

  ---

  You are required to make use of this function in order to generate an irreversible (hashed)
  duplicate of the user's password when you are storing your password.

  Additionally, you should save it in the database together with other unique features
  of your unique program.

  ### Exmple:

  ```elixir
  create_hash_password("USER_HARD_PASSWORD", :bcrypt)
  ```

  ---

  ### Pbkdf2

  - `pbkdf2` - pbkdf2_elixir https://hex.pm/packages/pbkdf2_elixir
  - `LICENSE`: https://github.com/riverrun/pbkdf2_elixir/blob/master/LICENSE.md

  Pbkdf2 is a password-based key derivation function that uses a password, a variable-length
  salt and an iteration count and applies a pseudorandom function to these to produce a key.

  Pbkdf2 has no known vulnerabilities and has been widely tested for over 15 years.
  However, like Bcrypt, as it has a low memory use, it is susceptible to GPU cracking attacks.

  The original implementation of Pbkdf2 used SHA-1 as the pseudorandom function,
  but this version uses HMAC-SHA-512, the default, or HMAC-SHA-256.

  ### Exmple:

  ```elixir
  create_hash_password("USER_HARD_PASSWORD", :pbkdf2)
  ```

  ---

  ### Argon2

  Argon2 is the winner of the Password Hashing Competition (PHC).

  - https://password-hashing.net/
  - `argon2`: argon2_elixir https://hex.pm/packages/argon2_elixir (recommended)
  - https://github.com/riverrun/argon2_elixir/blob/master/LICENSE.md

  Argon2 is a memory-hard password hashing function which can be used to hash passwords for credential
  storage, key derivation, or other applications.

  Being memory-hard means that it is not only computationally expensive, but it also uses a
  lot of memory (which can be configured). This means that it is much more difficult
  to attack Argon2 hashes using GPUs or dedicated hardware.

  > #### Use cases information {: .warning}
  >
  > Make sure you have a `C compiler` installed. See the Comeonin wiki for details.
  > Wiki link: https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/wiki/Requirements

  #### Configuration
  The following four parameters can be set in the config file (these can all be overridden using keyword options):

  - t_cost - time cost
  > the amount of computation, given in number of iterations
  >
  > 3 is the default

  - m_cost - memory usage

  > 16 is the default - this will produce a memory usage of 64 MiB (2 ^ 16 KiB)
  >
  > parallelism - number of parallel threads
  >
  > 4 is the default

  - argon2_type - argon2 variant to use

  > 0 (Argon2d), 1 (Argon2i) or 2 (Argon2id)
  >
  > 2 is the default (Argon2id)

  For verifing you can use like this:

  ```elixir
  verify_password(hash, "USER_HARD_PASSWORD", :bcrypt)

  verify_password(hash, "USER_HARD_PASSWORD", :pbkdf2)

  verify_password(hash, "USER_HARD_PASSWORD", :argon2)
